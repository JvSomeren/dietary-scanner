[CHANGES]

enlarge the font size. 
language and instruction in order to make them simple, clear, yet slightly more descriptive. 
[v] The screen of the dietary preferences would benefit from adding a visual feedback, such as icons, signs of confirmation and colors (red for marking with ingredients the user wish to avoid). 
[v] In addition, the confirmation button on the review screen must be enlarged and placed higher. 
[v] The button which turns toggles the flashlight was shown to not be descriptive enough, as such this will be changed. 
[v] Last, but not least, as none of the users scanned with the second camera, this feature will be deleted. 




[v] Welcome screen: 
[v] Welcome

[v] Select your language and confirm
Enlarge font of all text
[v] Change „Next” into „Confirm” 
[v] Enlarge button „Confirm” (At least double the size)


[v] Preferences screen:

[v] Change „Preferences” into „Ingredients” 
[v] Select harmful (?) ingredients ( I know it is a bit strange but could not come up with anything else)
[v] Is it possible to make just a list of ingredients just like with language preferences? And then some select it, this ingredient would be „marked” and turn red? <- This could solve the problem of making the app more visual, we could argue in the paper :P

[REMOVED] Do we need „Skip” button?
[v] Can we change „review” into „confirm”? And Skip the next step of reviewing ingredients? This was somehow troublesome for my users. If we manage to delete it, it would simplify the app even more. 
[BUTTON] Enlarge fonts and buttons



[v] Scan screen:
[v] Change „Preferences” into „ingredients”
[v] Enlarge the menu a bit if possible 



[v] End screen: 
[x] Idea „you can eat this” into white tump up or „Safe”
[x] „You cannot eat this” into exclamation mark or „Warning” 
[v] Text: Product contains: 
Enlarge fonts
